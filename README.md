# Citi-Bike Data Analysis

An unpublished version uses climate/environment raster data to overlay citi-bike usage during particular weather conditions such as heat/rain/etc. It could be used to understand how New Yorkers use citi-bikes during particular weather occurances. Therefore, we could integrate different micro-transit or mass-transit solutions in robust ways to adapt to weather.

Data uses Open Source Maps and Citi-Bike data directly from Lyft.
